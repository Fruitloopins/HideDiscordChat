# HideDiscordChat

HideDiscordChat is a Fabric mod designed for EarthMC. If you like to `/ch l global` but Discord chat messages get in your way, this mod is for you.

The mod is extremely simple with only 3 settings:

- A toggle to enable or disable the mod
- A list of ranks to filter, defaults to "*" meaning it will filter all ranks
- A toggle to make the rank filter an exclusive list, meaning any ranks written will not be filtered
  - This allows you to for example: write "Helper,Mod,Staff Manager,Admin,Owner,Developer" and only see staff messages
