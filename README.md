# HideDiscordChat
HideDiscordChat is a Fabric mod designed for EarthMC. If you like to `/ch l global` but Discord chat messages get in your way, this mod is for you.

The mod is extremely simple with only 3 settings:
- A toggle to enable or disable the mod.
- A comma separated list of ranks to filter, defaults to "*" meaning it will filter all ranks.
- A toggle to make the rank filter an exclusive list, meaning any ranks written will not be filtered.
  - This allows you to for example: write "Helper,Mod,Staff Manager,Developer,Admin,Owner" and only see staff messages.

Dependencies:
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) if you use Fabric mods already you almost certainly have this installed.
- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to access the config, if you don't install this it should still filter all Discord messages and not crash (I think).
